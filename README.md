# Frammy Cryptographic Framework

Frammy is an experimental framework for learning and exploring cryptography. It adopts well-known cryptographic concepts and introduces additional logic with the goal of making encryption strategies more robust.

**Important:** This project is in the early stages of development and should not be considered production ready. Use it only for educational or experimental purposes.

## Features

- Sample implementations of common cryptographic primitives using existing libraries
- Planned extensions that explore custom logic for added complexity
- Basic command-line interface for testing and experimentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (to be documented as the project evolves).
3. Run the demo scripts in the `examples` directory to see the framework in action.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please submit issues or pull requests if you have ideas for improvements or additional examples.
